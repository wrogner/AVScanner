# AVScanner

<span style="font-size: 130%">A ClamAV frontend to scan for Viruses.</span>

Sample project to exercise UI development, packaging and deployment in Python as proposed in 2023.

- Scanning relies on [_ClamAV_](https://www.clamav.net/)
- GUI is based on [_CustomTkinter_](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com) (a superset of Tkinter and TTK by Tom Schimansky).
- Python was updated from [_3.11.6_](https://docs.python.org/3.11/) to [_3.12.0_](https://docs.python.org/3.12/) during development.
- Builds are generated by [_build_](https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) using [_setuptools_](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html) as backend
- PyPI upload done with [_twine_](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Development follows a road map that will evolve continuously.

### Executable requirements
